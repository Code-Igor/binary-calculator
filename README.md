# BINARIE CALCULATOR
College assignment â€” our professor challenged us to create this calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication of two 1-byte numbers, either negative or positive. The result of the operation must also be a 1-byte number, and all the calculations are done using strings (as requested by the professor).
It was a really challenging project, but at the end I was satisfied with the result.
